set complete is not working automatically

1 more issue
    if major matches won by team then directly call match win,
    better we can do that in view it self.

recode all the html codes or do a check.

when set completed -> call update score html side
    
todo, 
    - for scoring url i removed category_id so remove it from passing in html pages
